This repository contains code and resources for predicting breast cancer using machine learning techniques.
The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately classify whether a given breast tissue sample is malignant or benign based on its features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set, 
which is publicly available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
It includes features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.
